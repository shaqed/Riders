#### Outline of the algorithm
The algorithm is based on the Christofides approximation algorithm for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem.

However - modified a bit to allow solving an S-T Traveling Salesman.

The basic algorithm is described below

#### Using the algorithm ####
We've implemented a rather simple Web interface to allow you run custom samples of inputs of the algorithm.

The algorithm itself is implemented in Java running behind Apache Tomcat 9. And the Web interface simply talks to it

You can use one of the following
* Clone the repo, run the implementation on a local `Apache Tomcat`
* Visit our Heroku App implementation at [https://riders2.herokuapp.com](https://riders2.herokuapp.com)

#### Proof of correctness and Approximation ####
